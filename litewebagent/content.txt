# Quicktour of PEFT

PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) is designed to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. The page outlines the need for PEFT, provides a practical example with a Q&A model, and details the steps involved in implementing PEFT.

## Key Points
- **Necessity of PEFT**: Fine-tuning large models can be resource-intensive. PEFT aims to alleviate this by tuning a smaller number of parameters.
- **Implementing PEFT**: One can fine-tune a model by freezing most parameters and updating a smaller set of layers.

## Practical Example
- **Train a Q&A Model**: The page provides an example using the Hugging Face Transformers library to train a Q&A model with PEFT.
  - **Loading Pre-trained Model**: How to load a pre-trained language model.
  - **Freezing Layers**: Instructions on freezing the majority of the model layers.
  - **Fine-tuning**: Steps for fine-tuning specific layers of the model.

## Summary
PEFT provides a means to fine-tune models in a more resource-efficient way by reducing the number of trainable parameters.
